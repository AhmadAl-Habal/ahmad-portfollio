  desc: `      Hello! I'm Ahmad, a passionate QA Specialist with over 4 years of
            hands-on experience in ensuring quality across both web and mobile
            applications. My background goes beyond traditional testing—I bring
            a holistic understanding of the entire product lifecycle, from
            frontend and backend development to system architecture and
            deployment. What sets me apart is my ability to take full ownership
            of complex projects: designing testing structures, building
            workflows, analyzing requirements, and collaborating with teams to
            deliver reliable, scalable, and user-centered solutions. I don’t
            just test for bugs; I ensure that every feature aligns with business
            goals, technical standards, and the best user experience possible`,
