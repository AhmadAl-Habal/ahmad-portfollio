  desc: `      Hello! I'm Ahmad, a passionate QA Specialist with over 4 years of
            hands-on experience in ensuring quality across both web and mobile
            applications. My background goes beyond traditional testing—I bring
            a holistic understanding of the entire product lifecycle, from
            frontend and backend development to system architecture and
            deployment. What sets me apart is my ability to take full ownership
            of complex projects: designing testing structures, building
            workflows, analyzing requirements, and collaborating with teams to
            deliver reliable, scalable, and user-centered solutions. I don’t
            just test for bugs; I ensure that every feature aligns with business
            goals, technical standards, and the best user experience possible`,

      backgroundDesc: `While my first steps in tech were with web development, my professional path really took shape when I moved into Quality Assurance. I started out with a focus on basic testing tasks, but as I worked on more projects, I continuously built up my skills and applied them across different types of applications and domains.

  Over time, I expanded my experience from manual testing into broader areas—covering functional, regression, integration, and performance testing. Along the way, I also developed leadership and decision-making skills, especially in situations where ensuring quality required carefully weighing options to balance timelines, features, and overall project goals.

  By combining structured QA practices with practical project experience, I was able to help deliver products that were not only reliable but also aligned with long-term maintainability and quality standards.`,

      backgroundDesc: `My journey in tech actually started with web development. I was curious about how websites and apps were built, so I began with frontend work—building simple pages and experimenting with design and interactivity. When I moved into Quality Assurance and while testing different applications, I naturally gain deeper understanding of how they were built and connected. That hands-on exposure pushed me to grow as a developer in parallel with my QA work.

  I began applying what I learned by building small web apps and online stores—mainly using React on the frontend and experimenting with Node.js and Express on the backend. Working from both sides gave me a clearer picture of how applications function end to end, and it allowed me to apply QA principles directly into my development process. This combination not only improved my dev skills but also helped me deliver more reliable, higher-quality projects`,

      backgroundDesc: `In recent years, I’ve developed my skills further to take on ownership of small to mid-sized projects from start to finish. Thanks to my combined background in QA and development, I understand how different parts of a project connect together—both technically and from a business perspective.

  This allowed me to bridge the gap between clients, teams, and project goals. By applying the right methodologies, such as Agile, I could align expectations, ensure smooth collaboration, and deliver the best possible experience. My focus on quality and development principles also played a big role in making sure every project I owned was not only delivered on time but also scalable, maintainable, and valuable to the client`,

Working with multi-language and cross-border data also introduced complications in formatting, validation, and region-specific logic.

  //     outcomes: `
  //       On My Way successfully launched as a functional MVP, offering a unique solution for peer-to-peer international deliveries. The app helped bridge the gap between people needing affordable delivery options and travelers looking to earn while on the move.

  //       Through this project, I gained valuable experience in cross-platform architecture, real-time data handling, and multi-role user experiences—skills I’ve continued to apply in later mobile projects.

  //       Moushref is an innovative cashless payment and school bus tracking system designed to streamline and secure daily operations for students, parents, and schools. The system uses NFC bracelets for students to make purchases, while parents can monitor and control their children’s spending, set limits, and prevent specific purchases. Parents can also load money onto their children’s wallets, ensuring a secure and controlled spending environment. Additionally, Moushref offers real-time bus tracking, allowing parents to follow their children’s bus route and receive notifications for stops and arrivals.

  //       Key Features I developed include:

  //       •	Cashless payments using NFC bracelets for secure, quick transactions
  //       •	Parental controls to monitor and limit purchases, including setting daily spending limits
  //       •	Ability for parents to block specific items from being purchased
  //       •	Wallet recharge functionality, enabling parents to top up their children's balance
  //       •	Real-time school bus tracking, giving parents peace of mind with location updates
  //       •	Push notifications for parents to alert them of spending or bus status changes

  //     challenges: `
  //       One of the main challenges was ensuring seamless integration between hardware (NFC bracelets) and the app, as well as ensuring reliable real-time updates for bus tracking. Synchronizing payments, notifications, and bus routes in a timely manner required careful architecture design and constant performance optimization.

  //       Additionally, ensuring the security and privacy of transaction data and the children's activities was critical. We implemented robust encryption and secured API endpoints to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
  //     `,
  //     outcomes: `
  //       Moushref is going to become a convenient solution for schools and parents, enhancing control over students' spending and improving safety with real-time bus tracking. Parents appreciated the transparency of knowing exactly what their children were purchasing and when the bus would arrive. The app helped schools maintain a secure and efficient environment for both students and staff.
