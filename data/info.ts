  desc: `      Hello! I'm Ahmad, a passionate QA Specialist with over 4 years of
            hands-on experience in ensuring quality across both web and mobile
            applications. My background goes beyond traditional testing—I bring
            a holistic understanding of the entire product lifecycle, from
            frontend and backend development to system architecture and
            deployment. What sets me apart is my ability to take full ownership
            of complex projects: designing testing structures, building
            workflows, analyzing requirements, and collaborating with teams to
            deliver reliable, scalable, and user-centered solutions. I don’t
            just test for bugs; I ensure that every feature aligns with business
            goals, technical standards, and the best user experience possible`,

      backgroundDesc: `While my first steps in tech were with web development, my professional path really took shape when I moved into Quality Assurance. I started out with a focus on basic testing tasks, but as I worked on more projects, I continuously built up my skills and applied them across different types of applications and domains.

  Over time, I expanded my experience from manual testing into broader areas—covering functional, regression, integration, and performance testing. Along the way, I also developed leadership and decision-making skills, especially in situations where ensuring quality required carefully weighing options to balance timelines, features, and overall project goals.

  By combining structured QA practices with practical project experience, I was able to help deliver products that were not only reliable but also aligned with long-term maintainability and quality standards.`,

      icon: `Globe`,
      backgroundTitle: "Web Development",
      backgroundDesc: `My journey in tech actually started with web development. I was curious about how websites and apps were built, so I began with frontend work—building simple pages and experimenting with design and interactivity. When I moved into Quality Assurance and while testing different applications, I naturally gain deeper understanding of how they were built and connected. That hands-on exposure pushed me to grow as a developer in parallel with my QA work.

  I began applying what I learned by building small web apps and online stores—mainly using React on the frontend and experimenting with Node.js and Express on the backend. Working from both sides gave me a clearer picture of how applications function end to end, and it allowed me to apply QA principles directly into my development process. This combination not only improved my dev skills but also helped me deliver more reliable, higher-quality projects`,
    },
    {

      backgroundTitle: "Project Ownership",
      backgroundDesc: `In recent years, I’ve developed my skills further to take on ownership of small to mid-sized projects from start to finish. Thanks to my combined background in QA and development, I understand how different parts of a project connect together—both technically and from a business perspective.

  This allowed me to bridge the gap between clients, teams, and project goals. By applying the right methodologies, such as Agile, I could align expectations, ensure smooth collaboration, and deliver the best possible experience. My focus on quality and development principles also played a big role in making sure every project I owned was not only delivered on time but also scalable, maintainable, and valuable to the client`,

   QA Samples is a dedicated project that highlights different aspects of Quality Assurance work through practical examples. It includes full test plans for web applications created with tools like Qase, along with detailed test cases, test scripts, and execution flows. The project also showcases automation testing examples with Playwright and Cypress, supported by sample code and real execution runs. Additionally, it contains performance testing scenarios with JMeter, illustrating how to measure and analyze system reliability under load. This collection serves as a portfolio of QA practices, combining manual and automated testing approaches to demonstrate a complete quality process.
